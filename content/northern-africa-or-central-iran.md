abstract: "One of the ambiguities in the history of Islamic calligraphy is the determination of the regions where each script prevailed in the first three Hijri centuries. This ambiguity is due to the dispersion of book leaves and the lack of reliable colophons in early copies. The J. Paul Getty Museum preserves a few leaves of a Qur&apos;an that is one of the significant examples of Early Abbasid style. This Qur&apos;an was discovered in Kairouan, Tunisia, so historians have attributed its origin to that place. Yet, evidence proves it was produced in Central Iran. This evidence includes the eastern-system diacritic and the Abjad script used in the sign for the numeral ten *āyah*s; moreover, its script resembles the monumental script of some of the signed New Style Qur&apos;ans copied in Isfahan and Rayy. Because the Getty Qur&apos;an is copied in D.I script (the subgroup described by codicologist and paleographer François Déroche), the D.I script can be attributed to Central Iran."

## Introduction

Islamic calligraphy thrived in two main realms in the first centuries of its flourishing. Officially, it was mostly employed by those charged with copying the Qur&apos;an and architectural inscriptions while adhering to prescribed rules and principles of calligraphy and attending to its aesthetic aspect through rigorous, direct strokes of the pen (*qalam*). Unofficially, it was generally employed in bureaucratic and everyday affairs, in which scribes used cursive and mostly unprincipled strokes of the pen. In the first realm, as early writers such as Ibn al-Nadīm and today’s researchers show, Hijazi (Makkī/Madanī) scripts shaped the first stage of writing the Qur&apos;an.
