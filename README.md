## About the Journal

## Using this Repository

This is one in series of multiformat publications using [Quire](http://quire.getty.edu)™, Getty’s multiformat publishing tool. 

We are dedicated to maintaining this publication for years to come at the permanent URL, https://www.getty.edu/publications/grj/19/, and in its various formats and incarnations. For any updates to the journal, we will be following something between an app and traditional book publication model. Updates will only be made in regulated chunks as formal revisions and new editions and will always be thoroughly documented here in the repository, as well as in the revision history included with each of the journal’s many formats.

The primary content pieces of the journal can be found in the `content` directory. The `main` branch represents the current, published edition at all times, and the `revisions` branch, when present, will show changes currently under consideration. We invite you to submit suggestions or corrections via pull request on the revisions branch, by posting an issue, or by emailing us at [pubsinfo@getty.edu](mailto:pubsinfo@getty.edu).
