**JOURNAL DESIGN NOTES:**

**Issue 19 includes five research essays and one shorter notice**

**Design: There used to be a "part page" for the shorter notices; will we retain that?**

**The TOC distinguishes Shorter Notices with a header for those. There is, however, no part page for research essays and no header for them in the TOC. Contents include editor’s note.**

**Essay Notes:**

Copyright notices should appear somewhere with each article (used to be at the base of first page)

Captions, abstracts, and author bios are included in each article file. Abstracts should be set at the top of each article.

A- and b-heads are in many of the essays, coded with Word styles and \## or ###.

Arabic: this issue has Arabic transliterations, diacritics, and transcriptions with Arabic characters. There are ayns and hamzas and other Arabic and Persian diacritics in: Lenssen, Overton, Sahragard. These have been coded in Unicode characters and should not be apostrophes.This is something I will also have the proofreader check carefully.

Sahragard: has Arabic text.

Sahragard: some bulleted lists and lists set as block quotes

Alai/Kidd: there are bullet lists with hard returns; and regular lists set as block quotes with soft returns

Alai/Kidd has a long appendix coded as block quote

Alai/Kidd appendix includes small caps and small caps with italics, sometimes with this style intentionally changing midword

Lenssen also has Polish diacritics

Poggi and Horakova: There are poems set as block quotes, some with additional spacing at the head of each line.

Placeholder submitted for Editor’s Note (ca. 500 words).

**ART NOTES:**

-   Please see submitted Excel log for sizing notes and other guidelines for the art in the layout. This also gives notes on side-by-side groupings.

Two tables: in Sahragard and Overton, both submitted in Word

Overton fig. 6: possible to make zoomable? because the text describes a detail of the tile you can see when zooming.

Pestarino figs. 3a–c: all details of fig. 1.

Generally, the panoramas in Pestarino should be zoomable

**TRAILING ILLS**

**None.**

**TRAILING TEXT**

Overton essay file: still cleaning this up; she sent it last night. 15,533 words (will send by Thursday)

Overton Table (will send by Thursday)

Editor’s Note from Doris

**Note: if the proof is ready early, please feel free to send it early, as our proofreader is hoping to get started earlier than the delivery date if available.**

Questions:

Four different ISBNs in Consonance?

I transmitted copyright notices, but do you need a running footer file for anything?

Do you need back-cover copy for the Quire format?
