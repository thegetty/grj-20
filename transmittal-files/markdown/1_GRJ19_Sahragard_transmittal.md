Northern Africa or Central Iran? An Investigation in Production Place of a Fragmentary Kufic Qurʼan at the J. Paul Getty Museum

Mahdi Sahragard

Abstract

One of the ambiguities in the history of Islamic calligraphy is the determination of the regions where each script prevailed in the first three Hijri centuries. This ambiguity is due to the dispersion of book leaves and the lack of reliable colophons in early copies. The J. Paul Getty Museum preserves a few leaves of a Qurʼan that is one of the significant examples of Early Abbasid style. This Qurʼan was discovered in Kairouan, Tunisia, so historians have attributed its origin to that place. Yet, evidence proves it was produced in Central Iran. This evidence includes the eastern-system diacritic and the Abjad script used in the sign for the numeral ten *āyah*s; moreover, its script resembles the monumental script of some of the signed New style Qurʼans copied in Isfahan and Rayy. Because the Getty Qurʼan is copied in D.I script (the subgroup described by codicologist and paleographer François Déroche), the D.I script can be attributed to Central Iran.

\## Introduction

Islamic calligraphy thrived in two main realms in the first centuries of its flourishing. Officially, it was mostly employed by those charged with copying the Qurʼan and architectural inscriptions while adhering to prescribed rules and principles of calligraphy and attending to its aesthetic aspect through rigorous, direct strokes of the pen (*qalam*). Unofficially, it was generally employed in bureaucratic and everyday affairs, in which scribes used cursive and mostly unprincipled strokes of the pen. In the first realm, as early writers such as Ibn al-Nadim and today’s researchers show, Hijazi (Makkī/Madanī) scripts shaped the first stage of writing the Qurʼan.[^1]

Some scholars say that the classification of the scripts used in the Qurʼans of the first Islamic centuries (the seventh to ninth centuries CE) originated in copies that were preserved in Royal Danish Library by Orientalist and theologian Jacob Georg Christian Adler (1756–1834). Adler, according to firsthand sources, first used the title “Kufic” to refer to the script of the five copies in the library’s collection. Years later, on the basis of information gained from the introduction to *Al-Fihrist* by Ibn al-Nadīm, Italian historian Michele Amari (1806–1889) proposed the Makkī/Madanī scripts as the first to be used in copying the Qurʼan,[^2] although later his definitive view was challenged by Qur’anic paleographer Estelle Whelan and art historian Sheila Blair.[^3] Using Adler’s methodology for her 1939 publication, scholar of early Arabic scripts Nabia Abbott tried to resolve the discrepancies between texts and the surviving manuscripts by proposing a classification of scripts into the double categories of Makkī-Madanī and Basrī-Kufic under the title of Hijazi scripts.[^4] Nevertheless, the problem of the diversity of styles and their nonuniformity with names of calligraphic scripts and terms from the texts remained unresolved.

On the basis of classification propounded by Muslim historians such as Nāji Zayn al-dīn in 1972 and Habiballah Faẓā\`ilī in 1973,[^5] another classification was proposed by British scholar Martin Lings in 1976 . In Lings’s classification, Kufic is reckoned to be the evolved form of the early scripts and, from the tenth century on, divided into two significant styles: Eastern Kufic, nearly encompassing Iran, and Western Kufic, encompassing Andalusia and North and West Africa.[^6] Despite this classification’s vast geographic and historic scope, which provided for a more rigorous recognition of scripts, it did not prevail.

Challenging the term *Kufic,* codicologist and paleographer François Déroche proposed a more precise classification of straight scripts used in the Qurʼans in the first Islamic centuries. Because of the indeterminacy of the place and time of the early Kufic script’s genesis, he regarded Kufic as inappropriate for this style of writing and proposed replacing it with the title “Early Abbasid.” Moreover, he called the Qurʼanic scripts of the tenth to thirteenth centuries—identical to Eastern or Persian Kufic—New Abbasid. After rigorous study of the letters’ forms—reported first in 1983 in his book *Les manuscrits du coran: Aux origines de la calligraphie coranique* (The manuscripts of the Qur’an: Origins of Qura’nic calligraphy) and then in 1992 in *The Abbasid Tradition*—Déroche classified the scripts of the Qurʼan in the seventh to tenth centuries sequentially as Hijazi []{dir="rtl"}scripts (comprising four groups), Early Abbasid (comprising six groups), and New style (comprising two groups).[^7] This way, he could organize the miscellany of the styles of the Qurʼanic scripts in each of the three periods.[^8]

Group D is the most numerous and diverse group of Early Abbasid script. It comprises five distinct styles, with one (D.v) being further divided into three subtypes. Déroche selected the basic letterforms for the purpose of comparison. Although the letters alif, *mim,* *nun,* and *ha* are rendered in different ways, their developmental sequence cannot be placed in chronological order. Generally, all types of Group D exhibit a thick script, with vertical upstrokes that are always perpendicular to the baseline.[^9]

As Déroche declares in an elaboration of his method of classification and analyses of Abbasid style, our lack of knowledge about the copying of the Qurʼan in the eastern part of the Muslim world is rooted in the fact that the surviving leaves with Early Abbasid script have mostly been found in the western part. Due to the unavailability of reliable sources and copies, Déroche regards the styles of Qurʼan scripts in the east as quite indefinite.[^10] Considering the evidence available to him at the time, such a claim seems understandable to some extent, as all the Kufic Qurʼan fragments in the collections of his investigation lack information on the place of production. Because copies and manuscripts, such as the Amajur Qurʼan,[^11] were relocated or endowed to certain places, we have no solid reason to attribute their origins to their places of discovery. He regards any attempts to pinpoint origins as futile. This, along with the issue of determining the historical order of the script styles, are the two problematics in studies of the Qurʼan manuscripts of the first Islamic centuries.[^12] Yet, there is evidence []{dir="rtl"}in some Qurʼan manuscripts that can guide us to determine the geographic scope of certain scripts.

A few surviving leaves of a Qurʼan attributed to the ninth century offer us the possibility to surmise its script style’s geographic scope. The leaves of this manuscript are dispersed in different museums and collections; the highest number are preserved at the J. Paul Getty Museum. Before dispersion, the manuscript was discovered in Kairouan, Tunisia. Two leaves are kept in the National Library of Tunisia (Rutbi 198); therefore, it has been attributed to Kairouan by historians including Martin Lings[^13] and to North Africa by catalogers of the Getty Museum.[^14] Yet, resemblance of its script to the style of the copies produced in Iran suggests that the place of production of this Qurʼan manuscript was Central Iran. This study investigates the characteristics of the Getty manuscript’s leaves and relates evidence for its place of production.

Each folio of text in this Qurʼan manuscript includes five relatively bulky lines, which is evidence of its production as a several-volume copy. This copy is likely to have been originally produced in thirty volumes, as five-lined Qurʼan manuscripts were generally divided into thirty separate parts, called *juzʾ*.[^16] If this is true, it might be surmised that each volume must have been eighty to ninety pages, considering the approximate number of words on each folio.

The ten leaves of the Getty Qurʼan constitute five bifolios. There are five lines on each leaf. Leaves one and two include *āyah*s (verses) of *āl ʿImrān* (3:122–26). Other leaves (folios 3–10) include *āyah*s of *al-anʿām* (6:106–22); apparently, two leaves of this part of the manuscript have been lost, as these leaves do not include *āyah*s (folios 3–10) 112–16. Leaf three, attached to leaf ten, includes *āyah*s of *ālʿImrān* (3:129–31). A rectangular illuminated panel is on the back of leaf 10v **(fig. 1)**. On this leaf (recto) is a three-lined frame containing the following text:

[سبع­مائه و تسع و خمسون]{dir="rtl"}

[عدد حروفه خمسه عشر الفا]{dir="rtl"}

[و ثمانه مایه و اربعون.]{dir="rtl"}

Seven hundred fifty-nine

number of its letters

fifteen thousand eight hundred forty

This is part of a longer text, called briefly “verse count,” in which the numbers of the Qurʼan’s chapters (*sura*s), words, and letters are expressed. Such text has been assumed to be a feature of Iranian Qurʼans,[^17] the most well-known of which is the Ibn al-Bawwab Qurʼan of 1001 now in the collection of the Chester Beatty Library in Dublin (Is. 1431).[^18] Yet, the most ancient manuscript on paper is three volumes of a fourteen-part Qurʼan written in the vertical format in New style in 327 AH/939 CE, which, according to the autograph of its scribe, was copied in Isfahan **(fig. 2)**. This Qurʼan was endowed to the Imam Reza Shrine in the early tenth century by a person named Kashvād b. Amlās.[^19] In the beginning of the manuscript (folios 1r, 2v), the verse count and the date and place of copying are written in golden Early Abbasid script on two leaves.[^20]

This information was also expressed in a four-volume Qurʼan in the horizontal format that was endowed to ʾalā al-Dīn Mosque in Konya, Turkey. Its scribe, Ahmad b. Muhammad b. Yāsīn, copied it in 383 AH/993 CE in Isfahan (TIEM, nos. 453–56). According to its precise calligraphy and conspicuous golden decorations, it was probably produced under the patronage of the courtiers of the Buyyid dynasty (945–1055 CE).[^21] The numbers of its chapters, words, and letters are written in circles inside a horizontal rectangular panel. Scholar of Islamic art Yasser Tabbaa lists and illustrates other manuscripts containing tables with verse counts.[^22] In the Getty Qurʼan, the rectangular panel on the front of the leaf (recto) is divided into two squares, each containing a circle. The four sets of intersecting lines radiating into the center of the circle intersect and form a diamond in the center of the circle. The surface decoration of the panel is totally overlaid with gold. The chain-like pattern of its margins and the ornamental dots of the background are all outlined in brown. This structure can also be seen in certain Qurʼan manuscripts copied in Abbasid style, an example of which is a fragment including *al-ḍuḥā* (Qur’an 93) to the end of the Qurʼan, written in Early Abbasid style, kept in the Chester Beatty Library.[^23] The Chester Beatty manuscript includes two such illuminated leaves at its beginning and at its end. On each of these leaves, as was described for Getty folio 10 above, is a rectangular panel made up of two square frames divided by four triangles (*lachak*). On the other leaves of the Getty fragments, as previously described, the text is written in five lines in gold. Each word or letter is outlined in brown ink to make it distinct from the background.

The *harakāt*, or diacritics marking short vowels, are shown by small circular dots in red ink: for *fatḥa* [,(ـَ)]{dir="rtl"} a circular dot is inserted above the letter; for *kasra* [,(ـِ)]{dir="rtl"} a dot underneath; for *ḍamma* [,(ـُ)]{dir="rtl"} a dot in the left side. Nunnation (*tanwin*) is shown with two dots, one over the other. These features correspond to the elements of style attributed to Arab grammarian Abul Aswad al-Duʾali (d. 69 AH/688 CE), a poet and the founder of Arabic syntax. He invented, as Egyptian encyclopedist al-Qalqashandī informs us in 821 AH / 1418 CE, three main *harakāt* plus *tanwin*.[^24] The vocalization in this copy is mainly used in the last letter of almost all words, for it is normally the last letter that defines a word’s function in the sentence. If no vowel pointing is applied, misunderstanding and change in meaning would be inevitable. This practice of using vocalization exclusively for the last letter is attributed to al-Duʾali.

Nunnation (*tanvīn*) in this Qurʼan is shown by two red dots. *Shadda* (a diacritic for doubling a consonant) is shown by a light-blue dot. There are no signs for *maddah* (long vowel) or the *hamza* (glottal stop). Because the light blue is the same one used in the illumination, the diacritics seem to have been inserted at the time when the manuscript was being copied. But the dots in dark blue otherwise surrounding the letters were inserted at a later time to complete diacritics or to demonstrate other modes of recitation (*qirāʾāt*) **(fig. 3)**.

In his research on colored Arabic diacritics in Qurʼan manuscripts of the first Islamic centuries, which includes analyzing information in the book *Al-Muḥkam fī Naqt al-Maṣāḥif* (**year TK;** The Precise **\[Precision?\]** in the Dotting of the Qur’an) by Abu ʾAmr ʿUthmān b. Saʾīd al-Dānī, historian of Islamic art and architecture Alain Fouad George has deduced new features of the regional methods of applying diacritics Qurʼan texts. George summarizes his findings in a table.[^25] []{dir="rtl"}According to his table, the vocalization of early Qur’ans copied in Iraq and Mashriq (a term designating the Arab east) was accomplished through the use of red dots for *fatḥa*, *kasra*, and *ḍamma*, two red dots for *tanwīn,* a red dot for hamza, and one dot after and above the *alif* for *hamza* followed by *madd*. A comparison between this table and the diacritics in the Getty Qurʼan confirms that the manuscript’s place of production is \[the historical region of Persian?\] Iraq or the eastern part of the Muslim world.

In the Getty Qurʼan, the marker used for the ends of individual verses is a rosette inscribed within a blue circle with colored dots seen in many of the Abbasid Qurʼans, which was assigned the code of 3.1.4 by Déroche **(see fig. 3)**.[^26] On folio 2v, the sign for the numeral five *āyah*s is a medallion inserted between the words, inside which the word “Khamsa” (five) is written and encircled by painted pudgy petals. This ornament is drawn over the last word of the *āyah* and almost conforms to group 4.A.I in Déroche’s classification.[^27] The sign for the numeral ten *āyah*s on folio 6r and 8v greatly resembles the sign for the numeral five *āyah*s; it differs in that, inside the medallion, the *āyah*’s numeral is written in Abjad letters. Plus, in the margin in front of the same line, another round medallion is drawn containing the *āyah*’s number in golden letters **(fig. 4)**. In the leaves of the Getty Qurʼan, the signs for the numeral ten *āyah*s are inserted in the margin in front of line three for *āyah* 3:130 (3v), line five for *āyah* 6:120 (8v; **see fig. 4**), and line one for *āyah* 6:110 (6r).

In the Abjad system, a number is assigned to each letter as its value. But the order of Abjad letters in the western part of the Muslim world is different from their order in the eastern part.[^28] Therefore, one of the main criteria for attributing a Qurʼan manuscript to the eastern or western part of the Muslim world is to examine the Abjad letters used for counting the *āyah*s, []{dir="rtl"}as art historian Jonathan Bloom does in attributing the early Fatamid Kufic manuscript known as the Blue Qur’an to the west of the Islamic world.[^29] The signs used for the numeral ten *āyah*s on the leaves of the Getty Qur’an, however, are assigned to *āyah*s 110, 120, and 130, as shown by [ق، ی]{dir="rtl"}, [ق، ک]{dir="rtl"} and [ق، ل]{dir="rtl"} . There is no difference between the numeric value of these letters in the eastern and western Abjad systems. One folio of the Qur’an under discussion in this article in the National Library of Tunisia (Rubti 198)[^30] includes *al-hajj* (22:43–44, 22: 63–66), which has a sign for sixtieth *āyah* written with a [س]{dir="rtl"}, one of the variable numbers used in the more common, eastern system.

Throughout, *Iʾjām* diacritics (the dots distinguishing the consonant pointing), are respectively shown by very thin oblique black lines. The signs to for pause []{dir="rtl"}while reading (*waqf*) are indicated by dots of light and dark blue over the letters. This method has been attributed to Arabic linguist Yahya b. Yuʾmar (d. 129 AH/756 CE) and Arab grammarian Nasr b. ʿĀṣim (d. 89 AH / 708 CE). Purportedly, the fifth Umayyad caliph ʿAbd al-malik Marwān []{dir="rtl"}(r. 65–86 AH/685–705 CE) and governor of Hejaz and Iraq Hajjāj b. Yūsuf-i Thaqafī (r. 73–95 AH/692–714 CE) ordered its creation and establishment to help distinguish between formally similar letters.[^31]

The handwriting of the fragmentary Qurʼan manuscript is bulky. Letters such as *alif* and *lām* are grounded on the baseline with no deviance. Déroche classifies the one leaf of this manuscript kept at the Khalili Collections, London, under the subgroup D.I and provides a description of its script.[^32] The characteristics greatly resemble those of the monumental script used for endowments, sura headings, and the beginning notes of certain Qurʼan manuscripts in New style. The similarities of style in these Qurʼan scripts are evidence of their production in the same geographic scope. The Qurʼan produced in Isfahan in 327 AH/939 CE (mentioned above; **see fig. 2**) is an example. The text with which this copy begins is part of an endowment, and the verse count is written in Early Abbasid style. Although the quality of the script does not show clearly due to imprecise outlining of the words, the geometry of the letters can be mapped onto the Déroche scripts, and the following properties can be extracted:

returning stroke of the lower portion of the isolated *alif* [(الف)]{dir="rtl"} is longer and tip-pointed;

medial *jim* [(ـجـ)]{dir="rtl"}is located on the baseline and the letter preceding it is located higher than it;

first *ʾayn* [(ع)]{dir="rtl"} has a wide, generally circular opening;

medial *ʾayn* [(ـعـ)]{dir="rtl"} is an inverted triangle, and the last ʾayn [(ـع)]{dir="rtl"} has a sickle-like kern;

*mīm* [(م)]{dir="rtl"} has a short horizontal kern on the baseline;

*nun* [(ن)]{dir="rtl"}, the bowl of *sīn* [(س)]{dir="rtl"}, and *yā* [(ی)]{dir="rtl"} are relatively big wide circles; and

single *hā* [(ه)]{dir="rtl"} is a semicircle relying on a vertical line[.]{dir="rtl"}

These characteristics conform to the general attributes of Déroche’s group D. Still, a more accurate recognition of the style of the script is difficult because, besides the low quality, there is an in-between quality to the letters’ forms. Most letters conform to subgroup D.I, but the curve of letters *nūn* [(ن)]{dir="rtl"}, *sīn* [(س)]{dir="rtl"}, and *yā* [(ی)]{dir="rtl"} are written in the manner of subgroup D.va, and *alif* [(الف)]{dir="rtl"} in subgroup D.III.

A stronger resemblance can be seen in other Qurʼan manuscripts in New style. An example is the beginning of the seventh volume in a ten-volume Qurʼan copied by al-ʿabbās b. Muhammad b. al-ʿabbās al-Maṣāḥifī (the copyist of Qur’an manuscripts) al-Qazvīnī, containing its scribe’s autograph on two pages in Early Abbasid script. Its script mostly conforms to group D.I; only the letter *hā* conforms to group D.III, and the curve of letters *nūn* [(ن)]{dir="rtl"}, *sīn* [(س)]{dir="rtl"}, and *yā* [(ی)]{dir="rtl"} are written in the manner of subgroup D.va (fig. 5). The autograph reads as follows:

[بسم الله الرحمن الرحیم]{dir="rtl"}

[کتب هذا الجز]{dir="rtl"}

[و اذهبه العباس]{dir="rtl"}

[بن محمد القزوینی]{dir="rtl"}

In the Name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful

copied this *juzʾ*

and illuminated it al-Abbas

b\. Muhammd al-Qazvīnī

The scribe is allegedly from Qazvīn, a city in Central Iran, located in 'Irāq-e ʾajam (Persian Iraq), or the mountainous region (Jibāl) according to the ancient geographic divisions of Iran.[^33] During most of the tenth century, this region was under the rule of the Buyyid dynasty (332–447 AH/945–1055 CE). Although the manuscript’s place of production is not noted, scholars know that, on the basis of another colophon related to a Qurʼan copied by this scribe, he is associated with the Buyyid dynasty’s court. He copied and illuminated the abovementioned Qurʼan manuscript between 387 and 391 AH/997 and 1000 CE for “Umm al-Umarā’s treasury” in Rayy.[^34]

Um al-Umarā or Um al-Mulūk (mother of kings) was the title of Sayyidah Malik Khātūn or Shīrīn Dukht-i Ispahbud Rustam-i Ṭabarī (d. 1028), the first Shiite woman ruler in the history of Iran. Belonging to the Bāvandiān family of Tabaristān, she married Fakhr al-Dawla Daylamī. Upon her husband’s death in 387 AH/997 CE, she officially became the ruler of the mountainous region (Jibāl) of the Buyyid realm of dominion. Her two sons—Shams al-Dawla []{dir="rtl"}Daylamī, governor of Hamedan (r. 387–412 AH/997–1021 CE), and Majd al-Dawla Daylamī, governor of Rayy (387–420 AH/997–1029 CE)—were mere children when they became governors. The forenamed scribe worked for the library of the Buyyid’s court; the script used in copying the manuscript is in New style and resembles the style of the aforementioned Qurʼan manuscript produced in Isfahan in 939.[^35]

These characteristics are also seen in the []{dir="rtl"}monumental script of another copy of the Qur’an. On the basis of its resemblance to prior manuscripts, it was most probably copied in the tenth century in Central Iran (Library of Astan Quds Razavi, no. 5015), although it is missing the date of completion and the scribe’s autograph. It is the fourth volume of a ten-volume Qurʼan in which the sura headings and the insertions on the pages’ margins are written in Early Abbasid style. Its writing and the outlining of the golden Early Abbasid are more exacting compared to other examples. In the sura heading of *al-anʾām*, the forms of letters with the vertical tooth of []{dir="rtl"}medial *ʾayn* [ـعـ)]{dir="rtl"} [(]{dir="rtl"}, the broad shape of *mīm* [(م)]{dir="rtl"} , the head of *wāw* [(و)]{dir="rtl"} on the baseline, and the short arms of *lā* [(لا)]{dir="rtl"} conform to subgroups D.I and D.va (**fig. 6)**. Some explanation about the place of the sura’s revelation is written in the same style inside the medallion beside the sura heading.

Another example of Iranian manuscripts having lines in Abbasid style is the copy of the Qurʼan written by Ahmad b. Muhammad b. Yāsīn, dated 383 AH/993 CE (TIEM, nos. 453–56). This copy, in four volumes, is produced in the horizontal format like the Qurʼan copied by al-ʿabbās b. Muhammad al-Qazvīnī. In circles inside the panels on its beginning pages, the numbers of its suras, words, and letters are written in Early Abbasid style. But, due to the script’s small size and the imprecise outlining of words, an exact recognition of its style is not possible.

The table offers a visual comparison of the main letters of the Getty Qurʼan; the main letters of the monumental scripts of the Qurʼan manuscripts written in New style in Central Iran; group D.I and D.va in Déroche’s classification **(table 1)**. The Getty Qurʼan’s script entirely conforms to the style of the monumental script of the Qurʼan manuscripts from Central Iran. Therefore, not only does it seem possible to attribute the production of the Getty Qurʼan to Central Iran but it is also possible to propose a strong hypothesis attributing mix of D.I and D.va script to Central Iran.

\## Summary

Efforts to recognize the place of production of the Qurʼan manuscripts in Early Abbasid script and determine the transformation of Qurʼan script styles in the first three centuries of hijra (622–913 CE) have always yielded ambiguous results due to the lack of reliable information. Yet, close examination of the Qurʼan manuscripts written in New style helps us acquire knowledge of regional styles of Qurʼanic calligraphy, at least in the eastern part of the Muslim world. Certain Qurʼan manuscripts contain inscriptions and insertions written in Early Abbasid style; due to their greater quantity and the intactness of their scribes’ autographs, they provide more accurate information regarding their place of production. Thus we have seen ample evidence that both the fragmentary Getty Qurʼan and the mix of D.I and D.va style can be traced to Central Iran. In short, the evidence is as follows:

The insertion of a verse count at the beginning of the Getty Qur’an, containing the number of chapters (suras), words, and letters, which is also included in New style Qurʼans produced in Central Iran, such as the Qurʼan copied in 327 AH/939 CE and the one scribed by Ahmad b. Muhammad b. Yāsīn in 383 AH/993 CE, both produced in Isfahan.

The resemblance of the Abjad system for counting the *āyah*s in the Getty Qur’an to the Abjad system common in the eastern part of the Muslim world.

The considerable resemblance of the Getty Qurʼan’s script to the monumental script of the Qurʼan manuscripts produced in Central Iran.

The resemblance of the diacritics used in the Getty Qurʼan to the tradition of the eastern part of the Muslim world, as found in *Al-Muḥkam fi Naqt al-Maṣāḥif* by Abu ʾAmr Uthmān b. Saʾīd al-Dānī.
